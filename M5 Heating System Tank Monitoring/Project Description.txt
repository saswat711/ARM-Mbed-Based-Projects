You are developing the monitoring (but not control) system for a heating tank in an industrial process. There are two sensors in the tank, one for temperature and the other for level. Four output states must be detected, each triggering a different audible status tone: 

Tank is full, temperature too high (upper third of temperature range) : two-tone  
Tank is full, temperature is good (middle third of temperature range): steady continuous tone 
Tank is full, temperature too low (lower third of temperature range): single beeping tone 
Tank level is too low (tank less than three quarters full), any temperature: frequency-modulated “warble”  tone, flashing LED 
Sensors must be tested at least once every two seconds. 

Write a program to meet this requirement, testing and demonstrating it on the Mbed simulator. Use potentiometers for tank level and temperature, and the Pwm speaker to generate the audible status signals.
